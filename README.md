# Sea Keeper

**Sea Keeper** is an application designed to collect, analyze, and manage coastline waste information. By generating big data, the app aims to improve the efficiency of waste collection management along coastlines. It is composed of four core functionalities: **Inspection**, **Management**, **Cleaning**, and **Collection**.

## Features

1. **Inspection and Cleaning**:  
   Sea Keepers, our field agents, are dispatched to coastal locations to inspect and record waste data. They also carry out cleaning activities and log detailed information about the waste collected.

2. **Management**:  
   This feature helps in analyzing the data gathered during inspections and cleanups, converting it into meaningful statistics. These insights aid in optimizing coastline management, resource allocation, and personnel deployment.

3. **Collection**:  
   For efficiently collecting the waste after cleaning, this feature provides detailed maps and navigation tools to guide collection teams, ensuring waste is collected from coastal areas in a timely and organized manner.

## Key Benefits
- Promotes the cleanliness of coastlines through effective waste management.
- Enhances the efficiency of resource deployment for cleanup activities.
- Utilizes big data to provide insights into waste patterns and inform decision-making.
- Includes real-time navigation to assist in the effective collection of waste.
